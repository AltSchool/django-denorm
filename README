This is the "signals" branch of django-denorm, it tracks updates to models
by hooking into Django's save/delete signals.
As it proved to be very difficult (or impossible) to implement all needed features
(dependencies on ManyToManyFields, handle bulk updates,...) this branch will not be
developed any further.
The "trigger" branch is now the new "master" branch.
